# Budget App
Made with Astro

## Todo
- Make auth more secure
- look into all the nullable props in Transaction Type. Remove nullables from zod if possible. look into infering zod schema

### Bugs
- when adding multiple transactions, only the last one gets added
- when adding multiple budgets,the form needs to be reset

### Upcoming Features
- make budgets a react component similar to transactions
- add and implement Accounts
- implement proper auth
- error toast
- search transactions

### Maybe
- DOM utils - cloneNode wrapper
- getClosest wrapper
